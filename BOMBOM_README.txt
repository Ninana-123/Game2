INSTRUCTIONS:
Spawn the units at their starting points of the map, defeat all the towers without your units getting fully wiped. Afterwhich, they will head to the main castle once every other tower has been destroyed, and once you destroy it, you win! However, if your limited resources get wiped during the level, you lose.

CONTROLS:
1. Click and drop the units from the in game GUI located at the bottom of the screen, if you dropped it at a non spawnable area, a text will pop up to tell you to only release the unit at a spawnable location.

2. Currently the prompt to go from one tower to the next is via a the spacebar button when the unit is stationary attacking the tower as we do not have a tower destroyed layer yet to check in order to switch paths.

3. The skip button to the victory screen is attained when the unit is stationary, then left mouse click and press the "w" key because w stands for winning :)

KNOWN BUGS:
1. If you were to spawn multiple units simultaneously, the first unit that was spawned may have a bugged out animation where it will not change animation even when it starts to move or attack again. Should not happen if you were to spawn them one by one after each one of them reaches 1 goal.

2. Spawning a unit from the top may cause the path to find the same tower again one more time before heading over to the castle.

3. When game is fullscreen, the functions work in debug mode, as in the units are going where they supposed to. However this cannot be confirmed in released mode.

4. Dropping the unit out of the window will cause the program to crash.

INCOMPLETE FEATURES:
1. Arrow is currently buggy and not able to work with multiple towers.

2. Health bar of units have not been added..

3. Arrow for archer unit has also not been implemented.

6. Death animations of the units are not added yet as well.

7. Unit recovery system not in place yet, such as how long before you need to wait for the next spawning or how many can you spawn.
